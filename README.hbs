# react-async-await

Async component that waits on promises to resolve!

## Motivation

Creating a promise is a synchronous action. If you hold a reference to a promise, you can eventually get the future value that it resolves to. Calling `setState` asynchronously in a component can cause a lot of headaches because of race conditions. The promise could still be in a pending state when the component unmounts or the props change. The `Async` component allows you to never worry about these race conditions and enables you to write your asynchronous react code as if it was synchronous.

## Install

```
yarn add react-async-await react
```

{{>main}}
